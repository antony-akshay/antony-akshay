I'm an undergraduate in Computer Science, deeply involved in the world of DePIN, Solana, and full-stack app development.
I spend most of my time building, learning, and experimenting in the blockchain and systems space — always chasing ideas that blend tech with real-world impact.

Lately, I’ve been diving into decentralized infrastructure, on-chain apps, and everything in between.
